Namely, these sentences will be used to generate fill-in-the-blank questions in which the keyword is masked and the student/user would be required to choose from a list of potential answers that includes the original keyword. Of course, more filters would need to be utilized in order to remove offensive or incorrect content from a final repository of public-facing multiple choice questions. "
