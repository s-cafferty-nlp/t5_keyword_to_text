# T5 for EdTech

## The idea here is to generate text from a single keyword.

## Try it here [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/s-cafferty-nlp/t5_keyword_to_text/blob/main/notebooks/hyperparameters_for_text_generation.ipynb) for a more thorough explanation of this project.

### SAMPLE OUTPUT:

```
Input: moose

Output:

I have seen moose and bears in the woods, as well as many birds of prey; but there is no evidence that they are native to this part of North America.

"I don't see why you shouldn't come with me," she said.
```

### This is cool!

Despite being fine-tuned on relatively little data, the T5 model is able to generate coherent sentences from a single keywork AND use said keyword in an appropriate context. This model could thus maybe become part of a pipeline for generating content for edtech applications. What fun!
